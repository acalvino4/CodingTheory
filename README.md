## An Introduction to Coding Theory

Communication of data is ubiquitous in today's world. Whether within a device or between devices, reliable data transfer is essential to proper function of the databases, applications, servers, and computers that comprise today's technological systems. Errors, however, do occur. They must be corrected. And math can help.

Here we present an introduction to coding theory. We will use Reed-Solomon Codes as a real-world example demonstrating some of its fundamental principles.
